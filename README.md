Test out the setup.
    1. cd into the docker-deploy directory
    2. `sudo docker-compose up`
        
        This should start up your web-app with an empty postgres database, listening on port 8000.  You should be able to connect to your vm on this port and interact with your web-app exactly as you expect.
